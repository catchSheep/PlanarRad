# Getting started with PlanarRad

If it's your very first time using planarRad, it's recommended to first build the [Hydrolight Comparison Document](./building%20the%20hydrolight%20comparison%20document.md)  , and check that the results match the [document in the repository](../../../src/testing/slabtool_test02/pr_hl_compare_MT_test.pdf).

After that, see the section on PlanarRad [usage](usage.md).
